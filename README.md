TODO: swing & thigh servo STL mod
      - ideal (from real world handiwork) is 20 mm (after 1.5 scale in mm in Rize OneTouch)
      - make sure to factor in the scaling difference when modifying the stls
      - don't scale until OneTouch setup (for consistency's sake)
	- could also double check the numbers after scaling (one in FreeCAD & upload to OneTouch 
          and another clean upload to OneTouch)
