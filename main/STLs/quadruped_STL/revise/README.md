TODOS:
- side_swing_motor_fixings (first print rest of the body and test assembley)
	- need to decrease wall width from inside
	- need to remove inner struts for the servo
	- may need to change roll servo attachment depending on first print assembley test
- thigh
	- need to decrease wall width from inside
	- need to remove inner struts for the servo

- PRINT rest of the abdominal support structures with the rest of the legs
- PRINT handles again (facing sideways)
- PRINT Battery Compartment with legs (or second print)

NOTE: servo hold in thigh and swing for leg, width is ideally 20 mm (after 1.5 scale in Rize OneTouch)
