TODOS:

- install arduino and interface with servos and IMU (and maybe ultrasonic)

- START WRITING C++ OPEN LOOP CONTROL & better understand & cleanup your sloppy code

- start building the servo legs

- figure out how to power everything
- CURRENT POWER METHOD IS MESSING UP SERVOS, AMP PULL PROBABLY THE PROBLEM

- test pi battery

- create 3D chasis
